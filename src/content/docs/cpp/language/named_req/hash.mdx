A ***Hash*** is a function object for which the output depends only on the input and has a very low probability of yielding the same output given different input values.


## Requirements
The type `T` satisfies `Hash` if

The type `T` satisfies `FunctionObject`, `CopyConstructible`, `Destructible`, and
Given

- `h`, a value of type `T` or const `T`, whose argument type is `Key`,
- `k`, a value of type convertible to `Key` or `const Key`,
- `u`, an lvalue expression of type `Key`.

The following expressions must be valid and have their specified effects.

|Expression| Return type| Requirements|
|---|---|---|
|`h(k)`| `std::size_t`|The returned value depends only on the value of `k` for the duration of the program. <br/> All evaluations of `h(k)` executed within a given execution of a program yield the same result for the same value of `k`.<br/> The probability of `h(a) == h(b)` for `a != b` should approach `1.0 / std::numeric_limits<std::size_t>::max()`.|
|`h(u)` | `std::size_t` | `u` is not modified.|
