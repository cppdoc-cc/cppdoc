title: Comments
description: Auto‑generated from cppreference
---

Comments serve as a sort of in-code documentation. When inserted into a program, they are effectively ignored by the compiler; they are solely intended to be used as notes by the humans that read source code. Although specific documentation is not part of the C++ standard, several utilities exist that parse comments with different documentation formats.

<div class="t-li1"><span class="t-li">1)</span> Often known as "C-style" or "multi-line" comments.</div>
<div class="t-li1"><span class="t-li">2)</span> Often known as "C++-style" or "single-line" comments.</div>
<p>All comments are removed from the program at <DocLink src="/cpp/language/translation_phases">translation phase 3</DocLink> by replacing each comment with a single whitespace character.
</p><h3>C-style</h3>
<p>C-style comments are usually used to comment large blocks of text, however, they can be used to comment single lines. To insert a C-style comment, simply surround text with `<b>/*</b>` and `<b>*/</b>`; this will cause the contents of the comment to be ignored by the compiler. Although it is not part of the C++ standard, `<b>/**</b>` and `<b>*/</b>` are often used to indicate documentation blocks; this is legal because the second asterisk is simply treated as part of the comment. C-style comments cannot be nested.
</p><h3>C++-style</h3>
<p>C++-style comments are usually used to comment single lines, however, multiple C++-style comments can be placed together to form multi-line comments. C++-style comments tell the compiler to ignore all content between `<b>//</b>` and a new line.
</p><h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Because comments <DocLink src="/cpp/language/translation_phases">are removed</DocLink> before the preprocessor stage, a macro cannot be used to form a comment and an unterminated C-style comment doesn't spill over from an #include'd file.
</p><p>Besides commenting out, other mechanisms used for source code exclusion are
</p>
```cpp
#if 0
    std::cout << "this will not be executed or even compiled\n";
#endif
```
<p>and
</p>
```cpp
if (false)
{
    std::cout << "this will not be executed\n";
}
```
<h3>Example</h3>
<div class="t-example">
```cpp
#include <iostream>

/* C-style comments can contain
multiple lines */
/* or just one */

/**************
 *  you can insert any *, but
 *  you can't make comments nested
 */

// C++-style comments can comment one line

// or, they can
// be strung together

int main()
{
    // comments are removed before preprocessing,
    // so ABC is "1", not "1//2134", and "1 hello world"
    // will be printed
#define ABC 1//2134
    std::cout << ABC << " hello world\n";

    // The below code won't be run
    // return 1;

    // The below code will be run
    return 0;
}
```
<p>Output:
</p>
```text
1 hello world
```
</div>
