      ```cpp
      constexpr bool is_leap() const noexcept;
      ```
    </RevisionBlock>
  </Decl>

  Determines if `*this` represents a leap year in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.

  `*this` represents a leap year if the stored year value
  - is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100; or
  - is divisible by 400.
</DeclDoc>

## Return value

`true` if `*this` represents a leap year, otherwise `false`.

## Example

```cpp
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    using namespace std::chrono_literals;
    for (const std::chrono::year y : {2020y, 2021y, 2000y, 3000y})
    {
        if (const int iy{static_cast<int>(y)}; y.is_leap())
            std::cout << iy << " is a leap year because it is divisible by "
                      << (iy % 400 == 0 ? "400\n" : "4 and not divisible by 100\n");
        else
            std::cout << iy << " is not a leap year\n";
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
2020 is a leap year because it is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100
2021 is not a leap year
2000 is a leap year because it is divisible by 400
3000 is not a leap year
```
